    # Tokenize and create a SpaCy document
    doc = nlp(text.lower())
    tokens = []
    for token in doc:
        if token.is_alpha and token.text not in stopwords.words('english'):
            tokens.append(token.lemma_)
    return tokens
4. Extracting Essential Information Using Named Entity Recognition (NER)

Utilize SpaCy's NER capabilities to extract entities like names, email addresses, phone numbers, skills, and education details.​

        'email': None,
        'phone': None,
        'skills': [],
        'education': []
    }
    
    # Extract email
    email_pattern = re.compile(r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b')
    email_matches = email_pattern.findall(text)
    if email_matches:
        entities['email'] = email_matches[0]
    
    # Extract phone number
    phone_pattern = re.compile(r'\b\d{10}\b')
    phone_matches = phone_pattern.findall(text)
    if phone_matches:
        entities['phone'] = phone_matches[0]
    
    # Extract named entities
    for ent in doc.ents:
        if ent.label_ == 'PERSON' and not entities['name']:
            entities['name'] = ent.text
        elif ent.label_ == 'ORG':
            entities['education'].append(ent.text)
        elif ent.label_ == 'SKILL':
            entities['skills'].append(ent.text)
    
    return entities
5. Structuring Data with Pandas

Store the extracted information in a Pandas DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis.​

python
Copy

    # For example, if the intent is to check application status:
    candidate_id = extract_candidate_id(user_input)  # Implement this function based on your NLP model
    candidate_info = get_candidate_info(candidate_id)
    if candidate_info:
        response = f"Your application status is {candidate_info['application_status']}."
    else:
        response = "Candidate information not found."
    return jsonify({'response': response})

6. Ensure Secure Database Connections

When deploying your chatbot, ensure that database credentials are securely managed, possibly using environment variables or a configuration management system.​

7. Test the Integration

Thoroughly test the chatbot to ensure it correctly interacts with the MySQL database, accurately retrieving and updating information as intended.​

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate your HR chatbot with your MySQL data warehouse, enabling seamless and dynamic interactions with your HR data.
